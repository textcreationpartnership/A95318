            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A true ſtate of the Proofs offered at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, by <hi>Robert</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Robert,</hi> and Grandſon of <hi>John</hi> late Lord Viſcount <hi>Purbeck,</hi> to prove the Legitimacy of <hi>Robert</hi> the Father.</head>
            <p>IT was obſerved firſt, That it is about 56 years ſince <hi>Robert</hi> the Father was born, and four ſince he died.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of how dangerous a conſequence it may prove hereafter, if a preſident of this nature ſhould be now introduced, (to wit) That a mans Legitimacy ſhall be called in queſtion ſo long after his birth and death. Or that a Son after ſuch an afflux of years ſhall be put to prove the Legitimacy of his Father, who died during the Infancy of ſuch Son, or elſe loſe both his Honour and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>But that all ſatisfaction imaginable might be given in a matter of this nature, it hath been proved by living Witneſſes,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term 1648, a Trial was had at the Bar of the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> between <hi>Vege</hi> Plaintiff and <hi>Robert Villers,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Father of the now Petitioner Defendant. Upon that Trial the Legitimacy of <hi>Robert</hi> the Father came in queſtion, for clearing of which point, it was then ſwore by a Midwife, that ſhe delivered the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> Wife of <hi>John</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Purbeck,</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> and that he was her Son born of her own body.</p>
            <p>The Nurſe that nurſed him, ſwore him to be Son of the ſaid Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> born of her own body.</p>
            <p>And it was further proved,</p>
            <p>That <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Purbeck</hi> always owned him to be his Son and Heir. That the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> his Mother owned him as ſuch.</p>
            <p>That the Lady <hi>Hatton</hi> owned him to be her Grandſon, Chriſtened him, and was his God-mother.</p>
            <p>That <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Purbeck</hi> writ him ſeveral Letters, wherein he called him Son <hi>Robert,</hi> and by the Superſcription directs them to <hi>Robert Villers,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That he ſealed Bonds to him, obliged himſelf to pay him money as to <hi>Robert Villers</hi> his Son.</p>
            <p>That his Lordſhip received ſeveral ſums of Money of him, gave acquittances for the ſame as received of his Son <hi>Robert Villers,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>John</hi> Viſcount <hi>Purbeck</hi> made frequent Viſits to the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the like from him; with kindneſs owned him always to be his Son, expreſſed great affection to him, gave him his bleſſing, and often drank to him by the name of Son <hi>Robert;</hi> many times declared great anger againſt any perſon that ſhould but queſtion whether he were his Son or not.</p>
            <p>That he delivered him the Keys of his Houſe at <hi>Stoak,</hi> when he came there, to keep, and would not truſt his ſervants; and agreed to live with him, and that he ſhould keep Houſe and board him.</p>
            <p>Often received Tokens from him, and talked much amongſt his friends of the kindneſs of his Son <hi>Robert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> in the life time of his Father joined with him in ſale of Lands, and in the Conveyances was written <hi>Robert Villers,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Son and Heir apparent of <hi>John</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Purbeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Purbeck</hi> enjoyed the Eſtate of the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> his Wife during his life, by the courteſie of <hi>England</hi> upon account of having <hi>Robert Villers</hi> his Son lawfully begotten on her body, born alive.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Robert Villers</hi> ſold <hi>Stoak</hi>-Park, <hi>John</hi> Lord Viſcount his Father made him allow him 6000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> for his Intereſt therein for life, upon account, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In the year 1647, the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> as Son and Heir of Lord <hi>John,</hi> compounded for his Lordſhips Eſtate at <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Hall, which Eſtate was after his Deceaſe to deſcend to him as Heir to the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> his Mother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Purbeck</hi> would frequently ſay his Lady was a very good woman,
<pb facs="tcp:152467:2"/>that he was extreamly ſorry he had uſed her ſo ill, declaring it was occaſioned only by his Mother the Counteſs of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jury upon this or the like evidence, amongſt other things comprehended in their ſpecial Verdict, found as followeth.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Frances</hi> Lady <hi>Purbeck</hi> had Iſſue-male of her body begotten during the Coverture between them the ſaid <hi>Frances</hi> Lady <hi>Purbeck,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>John</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Purbeck</hi> (viz.) the aforſaid <hi>Robert Villers</hi> his eldeſt Son.</p>
            <p>Upon arguing this Verdict by the Judges, Judgment was given for <hi>Rob. Villers</hi> the Defendent, and he ever after enjoyed the Eſtate in queſtion as Son and Heir of his Mother, againſt the Claim of <hi>Vege,</hi> who claimed under and in right of one Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> the Petitioner hath enjoyed the Eſtate in queſtion ever ſince his Deceaſe.</p>
            <p>This Judgment is upon record, and never reverſed to this day.</p>
            <p>Now to offer any Proofs in any Court againſt the Legitimacy of the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> were to aver againſt a Record, which in no Court will be admitted.</p>
            <p>And if all the matters aforeſaid were not ſufficient of themſelves to prove the Legitimacy of <hi>Robert</hi> the Father;</p>
            <p>Yet the Common Law will on this fact and other circumſtances, as length of time, enjoyment of Eſtates, living in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. abundantly do it.</p>
            <p>That the Houſe may be ſatisfied of the reaſons why <hi>Robert Villers</hi> his name was changed ſometimes to <hi>Wright,</hi> other times to <hi>Howard;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is humbly deſired that the Petition of <hi>Frances</hi> Viſcounteſs <hi>Purbeck</hi> preſented to the Houſe of Lords in 1640, may be read, which will abundantly ſatisfie the reaſon of that fact.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Contents whereof followeth,</head>
               <p>That 23 years before in her Minority by the command of her Father, ſhe marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Purbeck,</hi> who had with her a great Eſtate, beſides 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> paid to the Duke of <hi>Bucks,</hi> Brother to the ſaid Viſcount, upon the Dukes agreement to buy Land with it, and ſettle it on her and her Iſſue.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Marriage, the Counteſs of <hi>Bucks,</hi> Mother to the ſaid Viſcount, upon pretence of weakneſs and diſtempers of her Lord, cauſed them to live apart, during which time they diſpoſed his Eſtate, (which moſt came from her Father) and left her without maintenance; and when ſhe repaired to the ſaid Counteſs and her Agents for relief, ſhe was moſt barbarouſly carried into the open ſtreet by force, and there left void of relief. That her Husband and her Eſtate being kept from her, King <hi>James</hi> directed her relief; whereupon the Duke of <hi>Bucks,</hi> who had all her Eſtate, agreed to allow her 1000 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>per Annum,</hi> and her Jewels, Apparel and Houſholdſtuff: but when ſhe came to ſettle the ſame, clauſes were inſerted in the Deed to bar her from co-habiting again with her Lord on pain of forfeiting her Jewels, Clothes, Houſholdſtuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Annuity to ceaſe during ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation; all which her neceſſities obliged her to conſent unto.</p>
               <p>That afterwards ſhe and her Lord met ſeveral times, but it was privately, and concealed as much as might be, to avoid the forfeiture aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Sets forth, that though her Lord was thought ſo weak as not fit to live with her, yet they had in this condition gotten from him Conveyances of all his Eſtate of Inheritance, and converted great part of his other Eſtate to their own uſe, and poſſeſſed themſelves of all the Evidences of her Father's Eſtate, which ought to remain to her and her Iſſue.</p>
               <p>This done, and deſigning to ruin her Honour, alſo the Counteſs of <hi>Bucks</hi> with many others in her company, when the Petitioner was with Child near her time, and in bed, in a riotous manner, in night-time, entred her Chamber, haled her out of bed, and Sir <hi>Edward Villers</hi> Knight, one of the Company, inhumanely held her, that Midwives and others might ſearch her whether ſhe was with Child or not, to the endangering her and her Childs life: which barbarous uſage forced her to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her ſelf to a private place from her enemies, till ſhe was delivered, and to take upon her a feigned name for her ſelf and Son <hi>Robert,</hi> born of her body, and pretend to be Wife of one <hi>John Wright,</hi> meerly to ſecure both from their rage &amp; fury.</p>

               <p>And deſigning to ruin her in her Honour as well as Eſtate, ſhe was cited into the High Commiſſion Court for a ſuppoſed crime of Adultery, and there by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable illegal ſentence condemned, fined 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>

                  <hi>Reſolved</hi> (nemine contra dicente) <hi>that no Peer of this Realm can drown or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh his Honour, but that it deſcend to its deſcendants, neither by Surrender, Grant, Fine, or any other Conveyance to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved that no Perſon that hath any Honour in him, and a Peer of this Realm, may aliene or transfer his Honour to any other Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That amongſt all the preſidents inſiſted upon by Mr. Atturny General, there is not one ſingle inſtance of any one Peer his levying a fine of his Honour, that had Iſſue-male born to claim the ſame after his Deceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Objection that <hi>John</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Purbeck</hi> never had any Patent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is Anſwered,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That no Peer of the Realm can ſit as a Viſcount in the Lords Houſe, but muſt have a Patent; which when he is firſt introduced, is brought into the Houſe by the Heralds at Arms, and read by the Clerk of the Parliament. That he had ſuch a Patent is clear, for otherwiſe there had been no need of his Petitioning the King to give him leave to ſurrender the ſame, nor of the Kings accepting ſuch ſurrender, which it is plain his Majeſty did do.</p>
               <p>The Patent being ſurrendred, 'tis impoſſible for the Petitioner now to produce it, nor can a Copy thereof be had from the Enrollment-Office, becauſe the ſame is cut out of the Roll, as will plainly appear upon a view.</p>
               <p>But when, by whom, or upon what account that was done, is not known.</p>
               <p>In the Signet and Privy-ſeal Book of Accounts for the 17 <hi>Jacob.</hi> it appears 6 <abbr>

                     <hi>d.</hi>
                  </abbr> was paid for the Fees of the ſaid Patent due to thoſe Offices.</p>
               <p>The Docket of the ſaid Patent was entered in the Crown-Office the 19 <hi>Jun.</hi> 17 <hi>Jacob.</hi> It was alſo enrolled in the Haniper-Office the 21 <hi>Jun.</hi> 17 <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no entry of any Docket is made in the Haniper till after the Grant paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great Seal, nor in the Heralds-Office.</p>
